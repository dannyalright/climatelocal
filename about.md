## 1. Normalising climate conversation
Climate Local exists to normalise and increase conversation about climate change amongst the general public.

## 2. Inspiring climate action
Climate Local exists to turn 'fence-sitting' members of the general public into climate activists. We inspire action by surfacing constructive, creative opportunities within localities.
