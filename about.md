ClimateLocal exists to:

### 1. Normalise climate conversation
Normalise and increase conversation about climate change amongst the general public. Change the political and ethical tone into a quality of life one.

### 2. Inspire climate action
Turn 'fence-sitting' members of the general public into climate activists. Inspire action by surfacing practical, constructive, and creative opportunities within peoples' localities.
