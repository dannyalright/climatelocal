Greenmarket volunteers help with at-market promotions like cooking demonstrations, farmer support, and community outreach; Fresh Food Box distribution; Youthmarket cooking demos and more! Recycling volunteers help keep food waste out of landfills, facilitate community reuse events, conduct interactive recycling demonstrations, and more.
